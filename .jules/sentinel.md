Fixed XSS vulnerability by replacing dangerouslySetInnerHTML with safe React component rendering in ArchivePage.jsx.
## 2026-05-28 - XSS via AI-Generated Output
**Vulnerability:** XSS risk via `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` rendering AI-generated text in `src/pages/ArchivePage.jsx`.
**Learning:** Even though AI models generate the text, it is untrusted user input due to the risk of prompt injection or hallucinations.
**Prevention:** Treat AI output as untrusted input. Use safe parsing or rendering libraries (like React's built-in escaping) instead of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.
